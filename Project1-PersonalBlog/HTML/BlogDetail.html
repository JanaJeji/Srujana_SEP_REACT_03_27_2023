                <p>Every time you post something online, you have a choice. You can either make it something that adds
                    to the happiness levels in the world—or you can make it something that takes away.</p>
                <div class="box">There is always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough
                    to be it.</div>
                <p>I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard
                    to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my
                    best.</p>
                <h2>Heading</h2>
                <p>I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things
                    go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to
                    trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
                </p>
                <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
                <p>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones
                    you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your
                    sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</p>
                <div class="box"> Example code block</div>
                <p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
                    what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you
                    haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when
                    you find it.</p>
                <h3>Sub-heading</h3>
                <p>Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions;
                    they become habits. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your
                    destiny.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we do the best we can, we never know what miracle is wrought in our life or the life of
                        another.</li>
                    <li>In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: It goes on.</li>
                    <li>Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there’s so much to smile about.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.</li>

                    <li>Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Life is about making an impact, not making an income.</p>
